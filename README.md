# ChessAutoTrainer
A chess training application built during the research stage of my third year project into chess skill development. Creates puzzles from mistakes you make against the engine. 

Spaced repetition is a method for learning which I have used succesfully for chess openings. However, I think it has the potential to be used for more than just the opening phase in chess. Certain chess players (Michael De La Maza) for example have advocated the repetition of the same tactics to really drill in the tactical ideas and patterns. While I find that doing new puzzles might be better for that purpose, I do think spaced repetition and tactics and be combined not for general puzzles but puzzles generated from your mistakes. This will encourage you to reinforce the correction of your mistakes and make them less often. 

Intended use:
1) Use the play feature to play games with the stockfish engine, the program will automatically detect mistakes using the stockfish evaluation
2) After you have played a few games, use the train option to solve puzzles that are based on your mistakes via spaced repetition

The train function can also refute the wrong moves you suggest by playing on from after that move has been made, but this is not at an ideal state right now.
